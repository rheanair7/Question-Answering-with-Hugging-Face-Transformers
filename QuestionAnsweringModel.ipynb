            "The prefrontal cortex, located at the front of the brain, is responsible for higher-order functions such as decision-making, social behavior, and personality expression. It is also involved in planning complex cognitive behavior and moderating correct social behavior. Damage to this area may result in changes in personality, difficulty in planning or focusing, and inappropriate social responses. Recent studies suggest that the prefrontal cortex works closely with the limbic system, especially the amygdala, to regulate emotional responses.\n",
